# Bingo! User Manual  	         	  

When you first run the program, you will see a welcome message and the Main Menu
with two options: create a Deck (C) or exit the program (X). You can choose one
of these options by entering a c or x and hitting the enter key. The program is 
not case-sensitive so don't worry about that! Once you create a deck, you will
be led to the deck menu where you can choose one of four options: printing a card (P),
printing the whole deck (D), saving the deck to a file (S), and going back to the main
menu (X). 

(P) If you end up printing a single card, you will be prompted to choose the
number of the card you would like. Make sure you enter an integer within the given range and then hit
enter.\
(D) If you want to print the entire deck, click D and Enter and just wait for it all to print and 
admire the cards!\
(S) You can save the deck to a file. You will be prompted for the file path, so
make sure you know where you want it! You will be required to input the full file path,
including something like "C:/Users/username/cs1440-last-first-assn3/doc/deck.txt"
where deck.txt is the name of the file you want to write the deck to. This path is just
an example to show you that the entire path must be given, not just the relative
path. Once you type in the path and hit enter you're good to go! You can check that
text file to see the wonderful bingo cards if you would like.\
(X) This will take you back to the menu where you can choose to make a new deck
or quit the game. This is a good way to exit the program or make a new deck and 
totally scrap the old one.\
\
If you are ever prompted for a value and you enter one and the prompt repeats itself,
keep in mind that it does this because your input was invalid. Make sure that if you
are provided with a number range in parantheses in the prompt, you should enter an
integer. If you are asked for a menu choice, enter a single letter. If you decided
to add more letters, you'll be reprompted.\

Enjoy the game!
